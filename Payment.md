# Lottery!
You can type `>lottery <Number of entries>` to enter the lottery. The draw is at Eastern Time 01:00 AM everyday. Each entry cost 5 credits and the money goes into the jackpot.

# How do I renew my number?

**Since Discord disabled bot-to-bot DMs,** we cannot use payment bots. To replace them, we have added a `>daily` command so you can earn credits still.

### Checking your balance
You can use `>balance` in any channel, even the channel doesn't have DTel service enabled. The server must have DTel installed.

### I'm a developer and I want DiscordTel to accept payments from my bot!
Currently we cannot accept any payment bots right now. In the future we may let you, but this is still being decided.
