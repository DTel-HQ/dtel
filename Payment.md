# Win credits instantly!
Every 5 to 15 minutes, DiscordTel will announce a free credit giveaway in the **#general** chat of [DiscordTel HQ](https://discord.gg/RN7pxrB). Say `>claim` to get a randomized amount of free credits for your account, ranging from 8 to 200 credits! Be quick, the giveaway expires 30 seconds after it is announced. The credits that you win from the giveaway do NOT have any tax, so topping-up your number is easier than using third-party bots, which have tax.

# How do I renew my number?

## Payment bots

| Bot Name                                         | Tax Rate |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------|
| [Tatsumaki](http://tatsumaki.xyz)                | 20%      |
| [Mantaro](https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot) | 40%      |
| [Hifumi](http://hifumibot.xyz/)                  | 50%      |

*Side note: Tatsumaki's 20% tax exists on its side ("Amount due after tax" as you see), where Mantaro's 40% tax exists on our side. Hifumi currently does not have any tax.*

### I'm a developer and I want DiscordTel to accept payments from my bot!
1. Your bot must be in >1000 servers.
2. Your bot must be able to DM DiscordTel when a transaction to DiscordTel is performed, and the DM must include the user's ID and the amount paid.
3. Once you qualify for the guidelines listed above, contact austinhuang#1076 to figure out the tax rate based on your bot currency's rarity.

## 1. Figure out the tax rate

| Usage                         | Pay using Tatsu | Pay using Mantano | Pay using Hifumi | We get |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| Renew your number for 1 month | 2500            | 3333              | 2000             | 2000   |
| 1 message sent using payphone | 10              | 14                | 8                | 8      |

## 2. Earn money

Read your preferred bot's documentation to learn how to earn money.

## 3. Topping Up
In any server with both the bot and DiscordTel: **Make sure both bots are online**, then:

* `t!credit @DiscordTel <Amount>` for Tatsumaki
* `~>transfer @DiscordTel <Amount>` for Mantaro
* `~transfer <Amount> @DiscordTel` for Hifumi

Your `<Amount>` is the price *pay by respective bot* according to the table above. After you run the command you will receive a confirmation.

**WARNING: DO NOT TOP-UP WHEN DISCORDTEL IS OFFLINE!**

Type `>help` before you make a transaction to see if DiscordTel is online. If you did not receive the credits in your DTel account, contact [DiscordTel HQ](https://discord.gg/RN7pxrB) or `>dial *611` when DTel comes back online.

## 4. Checking your balance
You can use `>dial *233` in any channel, even the channel doesn't have DTel service enabled. The server must have DTel installed.

## Using your balance
### Renew your number
`>dial *233` in the channel that has DTel service enabled, then type the amount of months you want to renew for.

### Payphone
`>pdial <Number>`.
Using the payphone will charge you 8 DiscordTel credits. For other bots, see the **tax rate chart** above.
