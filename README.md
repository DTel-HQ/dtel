DiscordTel is a bot for Discord that allows you to set up a custom number and call other Discord servers.

The bot acts like a telephone network, but **cannot** make real-world calls.

You can >dial `*611` if you have any problems or questions about the bot, or if there is a problem within your server that involves trollers/spammers.
