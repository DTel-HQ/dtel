## What is DTel?
DTel is a Discord bot that allows you to communicate with other servers on Discord.  
The bot acts like a telephone network, but **cannot** make real-world calls. (sorry about that)

So, ready to dive into the world of DTel?

- Read our [documentation][website]!

- Want the bot for yourself? **Invite it** by clicking here! [![invite-bot-shield]][invite-bot]

## Contributing
There are a lot of ways to contribute to our bot, not just through code.  
The main way, and probably easiest, is by [inviting][invite] the bot to your server(s) and using it. Though, there are many other ways:

### Development
You can contribute to the development of DTel in multiple ways:

- Contributing on GitHub  
First read our [contributing guidelines][contributing]. Then you are ready to make issues with feature requests or bug reports. Or even resolve issues by forking this repository and making Pull Requests.

- Testing new features  
Join our testing server to play around with the newest features soon to come! [![Discord][invite-test-shield]][invite-test]. 

- Writing translations  
Are you fluent in both English and another language? Then you can help us make the bot accessible to more people! You can start translating the bot on [GitLocalize].

### Financially
All of us at DTel have a passion for programming, which is why we were able to create and maintain DTel over the years.  
However, hosting the bot isn't free. So if you like what we're doing, have a look at our VIP options by clicking here: [![vip-shield]][website-vip]
