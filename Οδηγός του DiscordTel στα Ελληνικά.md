# Welcome to DiscordTel!
This guide will assist newcomers in setting up DTel for their server!

## 1. Inviting the bot => Choosing its channel
Click [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=224662505157427200&scope=bot&permissions=84997) to add the bot to your server, then choose/create a channel to register your number in.

## 2. Choosing a number
The current normal prefix is `0301` for a channel number or `0900` for a mobile number. Before proceeding, please decide your preferred number.

All numbers are 11-digits. e.g. `0301XXXXXXX`. You can dial numbers using letters in place of the digits, so **if** you want to convert your 7-digit word to digits (e.g. 0301-LETTERS), you can use [this tool](http://word2number.com).

Discord servers with 100+ members that provide a service may be eligible for `0800`/`0844` prefixes. Contact austinhuang in the support server.

## 3. Running the wizard
`>wizard`

Run this command in the channel you chose earlier.

The bot will send a message like this (will be similar, not the same):

If you want a mobile number (prefix `0900`), run `>wizard` in a DM (Direct Message) with the DTel bot.

The wizard is only available to register `0301` and `0900` numbers. For all other numbers, please refer to calling Customer Support: `>pdial *611`.

## 4. Setting up the mailbox
`>mailbox`

This command provides access to your mailbox. When someone calls you, and you don't pick up or you hangup, the caller has the possibility to leave a message. To use this fuction, you need to set the mailbox up.
For this, type `>mailbox settings` in the channel with your number assigned, and you will see something similar to this:

Now, type `>mailbox settings [Your mailbox text]`. With that, you have successfully setup your mailbox!

Once someone leaves a message, you will receive a message, and to read the message, you need to type `>mailbox messages`, which will bring up a message like this:

To delete the message, you can type `>mailbox messages [ID] delete`. In the case above, the ID is 6dd7.
You can also call the person that left the message! For that type `>mailbox messages [ID] callback`

## 5. Confirmation
Congratulations! You set up your number.
The bot should send a message like this:
