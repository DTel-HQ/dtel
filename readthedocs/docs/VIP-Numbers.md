# VIP Numbers

DTel's VIP plan works with 'VIP Months'. By using `>upgrade` you can use your VIP Months on a number!

Please note: VIP benefits and pricing are subject to change. These will be announced in our [server][guildInvite].

## Current rates
£2.50 (GBP), €2.50 (EUR), $3 (USD) or CA$4 (CAD) = 1 VIP month.

If you wish to pay recursively (credit / PayPal / SEPA), use our Liberapay: <script src="https://liberapay.com/DTel/widgets/button.js"></script>
<noscript><a href="https://liberapay.com/DTel/donate"><img alt="Donate using Liberapay" src="https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg"></a></noscript>

Otherwise, you can manually donate to one of the three maintainers:

* Mitchell: [paypal.me/mdrademaker](https://www.paypal.me/mdrademaker) (PayPal: `mdrademaker19@gmail.com`) - EUR preferred
* Rhys (Sun): PayPal: `rhys0710@live.com` - GBP preferred
* Austin (Bus): [austinhuang.me/donate](https://austinhuang.me/donate) (PayPal / Interac e-Transfer: `austinhuang0131@gmail.com`) - CAD preferred

Please include your username + discriminator in the comment field. If you do not, a copy of your email receipt is required to claim your VIP month(s).

Please note the following:

* VIP Months must be purchased in increments of whole months.
* Payment fees, if applicable, are deducted from the donation.
* Other payment methods (Robux, gift cards, etc.) are accepted on a case-by-case basis. Please `>call *611` to discuss these.

## Benefits

*	**Disable number recognition**<br/>
	With a VIP number you have the ability to disable number recognition.
	This means that the other side will be unable to see your number and the usernames of those speaking.
	Most details (*not all*) will also be hidden from our public logs.
	(Please note that this feature is disabled by default - enable it by calling `*411`.)<br/><br/>
*	**Custom name**<br/>
	You can set a custom name for your number.
	This name will show up besides your number (or instead of it with number recognition disabled) when calling another number!<br/><br/>
*	**VIP emote**<br/>
	Your messages will display the (yellow) VIP phone emote, instead of the default (blue) one.<br/><br/>
*	**Changing your number**<br/>
	Requesting a number change or channel moce (by dialing `*611`) won't get rid of all your messages, contacts, phonebook settings or VIP settings.<br/><br/>
*	**Number expiry**<br/>
	If your number is set to expire before the end of your VIP month(s), it will be extended to when your last VIP month expires.<br/><br/>
*	**Reduced >pay fee**<br/>
	When sending someone credits with `>pay`, there will only be a 5% fee as opposed to 15% for non-VIP users.


## Options
You can find your new VIP options in the `*411` menu.<br/>
_Note that you need the `Manage Server` permission to access these._
