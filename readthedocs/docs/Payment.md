# How do I keep my number running?
Keeping your number active has a monthly cost of 500 credits. You may renew your number in 2 ways:

* **Automatic**: 500 credits will be deducted every month from the account of the number's owner (the server owner or, in the case of DM numbers, the user) on the day of the number's expiry.
* **Manual**: Type `>dial *233` in the channel of the number you would like to renew, then respond with how many months you would like to renew your number for (or 0 for none). It costs 500 credits for every month you would like to renew it for.

## Check your balance
You can use `>balance` in any channel, even the channel doesn't have DTel service enabled. The server must have DTel added, though.

## Earn some credits
