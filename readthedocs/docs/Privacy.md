# Privacy

Privacy is an imporant part of any bot or application. Here is the data we collect:

![form](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/377854783001853953/707450182912180315/sketch-1588739653961.png)

The same data is also stored (publically) in #bot-log of the [support server](https://discord.gg/RN7pxrB), except certain call-related info of [VIP numbers](./VIP-Numbers).

In addition, should you have a number in your server, any Customer Support member can summon an invite and join your server whenever we deem necessary. If you believe such actions are not justified, please email `dtel@austinhuang.me`. It will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

The data is stored on a server owned by SunburntRock89#6617.
