**NOTE: translations will only used in v4, which is currently in early development. All progress may be lost/altered later on.**

# Translations
DTel should be accessible for everyone wanting to use it, regardless of language.
Therefore, for v4 of the bot we are working on full translations.

## We need your help!
Without the help of our community (you) we can't make these translations happen.
You can start translating by visiting our [GitLocalize][Git Localize] page (read the guide below first).

See the badges below for our current progress.
If you want to request a different language, join our [support server][Support Server] and ask Bus or Mitchell to add it.

## Translating guide
* Commands:  
  For now, please just fill in the 'usage' property as-is, since it will always pick the English version.
  You should, however, translate both the name and description (if applicable).
* Other:  
  As commands are currently not translated, please keep references to commands in English.
